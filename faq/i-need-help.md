# I need help

If you have questions or need help, please do not open a GitHub issue as we use GitHub issues only to discuss about bugs and new features for the PrestaShop project.

The very best place to start looking for an answer is:

- Here (the Developer documentation), if you are a developer
- The [User's guide](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/v.8-documentation/v/english/) if you are a user

{{% notice tip %}}
If you are a developer and you think there is a missing item in the Developer documentation, consider [creating an issue on the Documentation Repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues). This will help us discuss what to do to improve it.

Finally, you can also ask for help from other PrestaShop users:

- [on the Community chat]({{< param "projectUrls.slack" >}}) (Slack)
- [on the project's GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/discussions/categories/q-a)
- [on the Community forums](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/)
- [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prestashop)
