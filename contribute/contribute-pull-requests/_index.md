# How to contribute code changes

If you're reading this, thank you! This means you're interested in contributing to PrestaShop.

To be able to contribute you need:

* a **GitHub account** (you can [create one for free](https://github.com/join))
* to know the **basics of git** and **how to use a GitHub fork**
* to be able to run **PrestaShop** from source code

PrestaShop is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop). The way to submit code changes to the project is through the standard *forks and pull requests flow*, which is explained in the [GitHub Forking Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

If you have trouble using this flow, you can find out more at [GitHub help](https://help.github.com) or by reading one of these detailed tutorials:

- [The beginner's guide to contributing to a GitHub project
](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)
- [Using the Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow
](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/)
- [How to contribute (via pull request) to an open-source GitHub project using your own fork](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-github-project-using-your-own-fork/)
- [How to Fork and contribute to a Github repo](https://dev.to/ceri_anne_dev/how-to-fork-and-contribute-to-a-github-repo-5bfp)

While it may seem complex, this flow is the standard way most open source projects use to handle contributions. [This article](https://dev.to/mathieuks/introduction-to-github-fork-workflow-why-is-it-so-complex-3ac8) about the flow can help you understand the reasons for each part of the process.
