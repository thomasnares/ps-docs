# How testing works in PrestaShop

PrestaShop is a complex software and uses automated testing to ensure that the new additions to the codebase do not break existing behaviors.

Automated tests are located in `tests` folders

## What kind of tests does PrestaShop use?

In the `tests` folder, you will find:

- [Integration tests](/8/testing/integration-tests/)
- [Unit tests](/8/testing/unit-tests/)
- [User interface tests](/8/testing/ui-tests/)
